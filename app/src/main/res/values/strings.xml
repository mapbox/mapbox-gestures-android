    <string name="help_description">In this small demo of the Mapbox Gestures for Android library you can manipulate the Mapbox logo with gestures - rotate, scale, shove, scroll, double tap or two finger tap to move, rotate and resize the image.
        \n\nPick any position from \'Mutually exclusive\' list to block any other listed gestures when progressive gesture (rotate, scale or shove) is executing.
        \n\nSwitch on or off velocity animations that will continue to change the image after you lift off your fingers based on the gestures speed.
        \n\nSet threshold for rotate or scale gestures with sliders below.</string>

# Mapbox Gestures for Android

The Mapbox Gestures for Android library wraps [GestureDetectorCompat](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/view/GestureDetectorCompat.html) and [ScaleGestureDetector](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/ScaleGestureDetector.html) as well as introduces implementation of rotate, move, shove and tap gesture detectors.

Mapbox Gestures for Android was inspired by [Android Gesture Detector Framework](https://github.com/Almeros/android-gesture-detectors) and offers the same functionality with some additional features on top.

The library is implemented in the projects found below, where you can head for more examples:

- [The Mapbox Maps SDK for Android](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native)
- [This library's sample app](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gestures-android/tree/master/app/src/main/java/com/mapbox/android/gestures/testapp) included in this repository

Are you using the library in your project as well? Let us know or create a PR, we'll be more than happy to add it to the list!
